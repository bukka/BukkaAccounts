# Accounts Mondule

This is a testing module that allows listing, adding, editing and deleting incomes using ZF2.

## Installation

Use composer

```
$ composer require bukka/bukka-accounts 0.*
```

Then add the module to the `application.config.php`.

You also need to make module public directory accessible from web server. The easiest way how to do that is to use [AssetManager](https://github.com/RWOverdijk/AssetManager).
